                Is a Japanese multinational holding company, video game production enterprise and entertainment
                conglomerate.
                It releases role-playing game franchises, such as Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Kingdom Hearts,
                among
                numerous others. Outside of video game publishing and development, it is also in the business of
                merchandise, arcade facilities, and manga publication under its Gangan Comics brand.

                The original Square Enix Co., Ltd. was formed in April 2003 from a merger between Square and Enix,
                with
                the
                latter as the surviving company. Each share of Square's common stock was exchanged for 0.85 shares
                of
                Enix's
                common stock. At the time, 80% of Square Enix staff were made up of former Square employees. As part
                of
                the
                merger, former Square president Yoichi Wada was appointed the president of the new corporation,
                while
                former
                Enix president Keiji Honda was named vice president. Yasuhiro Fukushima, the largest shareholder of
                the
                combined corporation and founder of Enix, became chairman. In October 2008, Square Enix conducted a
                company
                split between its corporate business and video game operations, reorganizing itself as the holding
                company
                Square Enix Holdings Co., Ltd., while its internally domestic video game operations were formed
                under
                the
                subsidiary Square Enix Co., Ltd. The group operates American, Chinese, Indian, and European
                branches,
                based
                in Los Angeles, Beijing, Bangalore, and London respectively.

                Several of Square Enix's franchises have sold over 10 million copies worldwide after 2020, with
                Final
                Fantasy selling 173 million, Dragon Quest selling 85 million, and Kingdom Hearts shipping 36
                million.
                In 2005, Square Enix acquired arcade corporation Taito. In 2009, Square Enix acquired Eidos plc, the
                parent
                company of British game publisher Eidos Interactive, which was then absorbed into its European
                branch.
                Square Enix is headquartered at the Shinjuku Eastside Square Building in Shinjuku, Tokyo, and has
                over
                5,000
                employees worldwide through its base operations and subsidiaries.

                    Dragon Quest,previously published as Dragon Warrior in North America until 2005,is a Japanese media
                    franchise created by Armor Project (Yuji Horii), Bird Studio (Akira Toriyama) and Sugiyama Kobo
                    (Koichi Sugiyama) to its publisher Enix, with all of the involved parties co-owning the copyright of
                    the series since then. The games are published by Square Enix (formerly Enix) since its inception,
                    with localized remakes and ports of later installments for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, and
                    Nintendo Switch being published by Nintendo outside of Japan. With its first game published in 1986,
                    there are eleven main-series games, along with numerous spin-off games. In addition, there have been
                    numerous manga, anime and novels published under the franchise, with nearly every game in the main
                    series having a related adaptation.The basic premise of most Dragon Quest games is to play a hero
                    (actually named "Hero" in spinoff fiction, but in some games, the player is able to name their hero)

                    is out to save the land from peril at the hands of a powerful evil enemy, with the hero usually
                    accompanied by a group of party members. Common elements persist throughout the series and its
                    spinoff

                    a
                    text-based menu system; and random encounters in most of the main series.The basic premise of most

                    <h2>Final-Fantasy VII</h2>
                    Final Fantasy VII is a 1997 role-playing video game developed by Square for the PlayStation console.
                    It
                    is the seventh main installment in the Final Fantasy series. Published in Japan by Square, it was
                    released in other regions by Sony Computer Entertainment and became the first in the main series to
                    see
                    a PAL release. The game's story follows Cloud Strife, a mercenary who joins an eco-terrorist
                    organization to stop a world-controlling megacorporation from using the planet's life essence as an
                    energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of Sephiroth, a superhuman who seeks to
                    wound
                    the planet and harness its healing power in order to be reborn as a demigod. During the journey,
                    Cloud
                    builds close friendships with his party members, including Aerith Gainsborough, who holds the secret
                    to
                    saving their world.

                    Development began in 1994, originally for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. After delays and
                    technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the
                    PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the CD-ROM format. Veteran Final Fantasy staff
                    returned,
                    including series creator and producer Hironobu Sakaguchi, director Yoshinori Kitase, and composer
                    Nobuo
                    Uematsu. The title became the first in the series to use full motion video and 3D computer graphics,
                    which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D pre-rendered backgrounds. Although the
                    gameplay
                    systems remained mostly unchanged from previous entries, Final Fantasy VII introduced more
                    widespread
                    science fiction elements and a more realistic presentation. The combined development and marketing
                    budget was around US$80 million.
